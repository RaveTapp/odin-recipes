    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. 
            Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil; stir until butter melts. Add corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes.
            Remove corn to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in the pot. 
            Add red onion and cook for 1 minute. Add garlic and rice and stir until each grain of rice is coated with the oil mixture. 
            Cook until rice is slightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour in white wine and simmer for about 30 seconds. Stir in chicken broth.
        </li>
        <li>Turn off Saute function. Close and lock the lid. 
            Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. 
            Allow 5 to 10 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>
            Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. 
            Unlock and remove the lid. Add corn and remaining 2 tablespoons butter; stir until risotto is creamy, about 1 minute.
             Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese until melted and well combined. Garnish with parsley.
