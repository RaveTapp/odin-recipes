# odin-recipes

Live site: https://ravetapp.github.io/odin-recipes/

The site for now is just a basic layout including only html code.

It features some recipes, that are not original, but taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/

Would need to download images and add them to a new images directory.

Otherwise it was quite an easy first project, because of a bit of knowledge from years ago. 
This was just remembering the html part and learning to operate with git in the command line.
